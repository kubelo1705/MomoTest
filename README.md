# MomoTest
## SODA MACHINE
## Layer Architecture:
#### 1.Model: include Objects need to use
#### 2.DAO: Handle logic with each object in model
#### 3.Map: Map data from file or database to object
## Stored data: in my opinion, there are two ways
#### 1. Stored in file (bad) because it's local memory and easy to edit.
#### 2. Stored in database (good) because we can manage data remotely. We must have username and password to connect to database. So i think it more security.
#### In this test, i use both. I use JDBC to connect database.
